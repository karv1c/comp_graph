# Computational graph
## Description:
Computational graph is a direct acyclic graph, where each node takes one or multiple inputs and produces one or more outputs. All inputs and outputs are floating point values (f32).
For example:
y = x1 + x2 * sin(x2 + pow(x3, 3))
where x1, x2, x3 are computation graph inputs and y is a graph output. 3 is the exponent for
power function.

## Task:
The task is to create a computational graph structure which can:
1. Take an arbitrary number of inputs
2. Can hold arbitrary graph of operations
3. Can compute a graph with compute() method
4. Each node should have its own cache (the result of compute() method) and should invalidate caches of dependent nodes. For example, if x1 changes in the above example only the last sum(a,b) has to be recomputed.
